# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to explore and implement neural networks using the TensorFlow platform in Python. The major costs and benefits of different neural networks were discussed and these costs have been compared to traditional machine learning classification and regression models. Also,implementing neural networks and deep neural networks across a number of different datasets, including image, natural language, and numerical datasets have been practised. The main objectives were to
* Compare the differences between the traditional machine learning classification and regression models and the neural network models.
* Describe the perceptron model and its components.
* Implement neural network models using TensorFlow.
* Explain how different neural network structures change algorithm performance.
* Preprocess and construct datasets for neural network models.
* Compare the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks.
* Implement deep neural network models using TensorFlow.
Using the features in the provided dataset from Alphabet Soup, a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup was created. Alphabet Soupâ€™s dataset (CSV) had more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.
